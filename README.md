⚗️ Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer

Hybrid Web + Desktop Application for Chemical Data Analysis

The Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer is a hybrid application developed as part of a FOSSEE project. It combines a single Django backend API with both web and desktop interfaces to provide powerful visualization and analysis of chemical equipment data.

The platform enables users to upload CSV datasets containing equipment parameters such as equipment name, type, flowrate, pressure, and temperature. The backend processes this data and delivers analytical insights, which are visualized through tables and charts across both the web and desktop applications.

This project demonstrates:

Efficient CSV data processing

Backend–frontend API integration

Multi-platform visualization (Web + Desktop)

Practical data analytics implementation

✨ Features
📤 CSV File Upload

Upload CSV files containing chemical equipment parameters.

Supports structured industrial datasets for analysis.

📊 Data Analysis

The backend computes key insights including:

Total equipment count

Average flowrate, pressure, and temperature

Equipment-type distribution statistics

📈 Data Visualization

Web Application: Interactive charts using Chart.js

Desktop Application: Analytical visualizations via Matplotlib

🧾 Tabular Data Display

Structured tables displaying equipment details.

Easy comparison and inspection of parameter values.

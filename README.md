Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer-Hybrid Web + Desktop Application 📌 Project Overview The Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer is a hybrid application developed as part of a project under FOSSEE. It consists of a single Django backend API consumed by: a Web Application built with React.js a Desktop Application built with PyQt5 The application allows users to upload a CSV file containing chemical equipment parameters such as equipment name, type, flowrate, pressure, and temperature. The backend processes the uploaded data and provides analytical results, which are visualized through tables and charts in both the web and desktop interfaces. The project demonstrates effective CSV data handling, backend–frontend API integration, and data visualization across multiple platforms. 🧩 Tech Stack Layer Technology Backend Django + Django REST Framework Data Processing Pandas Database SQLite (default Django DB) Web Frontend React.js + Chart.js Desktop Frontend PyQt5 + Matplotlib Version Control Git & GitHub Implemented Features 📤 CSV File Upload Upload CSV files containing chemical equipment data 📊 Data Analysis Total equipment count Average flowrate, pressure, and temperature Equipment type-wise distribution 📈 Data Visualization Interactive charts using Chart.js (Web) Analytical charts using Matplotlib (Desktop) 🧾 Tabular Data Display Structured table showing equipment details 🔮 Future Enhancements User authentication and role-based access Storage and retrieval of previously uploaded datasets PDF report generation Cloud deployment Advanced analytics and trend detection Sample CSV Format Equipment Name,Type,Flowrate,Pressure,Temperature Pump A,Pump,120,5.6,80 Valve B,Valve,90,3.2,60 Reactor C,Reactor,200,8.1,120 Backend Setup (Django) cd backend python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt python manage.py migrate python manage.py runserver Web Frontend Setup (React) cd frontend npm install npm start Desktop Application Setup (PyQt5) cd desktopapp python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt python main.py Backend API Overview The Django backend exposes REST APIs to: Accept CSV file uploads Parse and analyze data using Pandas Return computed summary statistics Serve data to both Web and Desktop frontends
